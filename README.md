# Application-Projects-CLI-GUI
This repository hosts a collection of diverse application projects, encompassing both Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. Developed by VActTechnologies, these projects showcase various functionalities and demonstrate programming in different environments.

Technologies Used

    Python: The majority of the projects are developed using Python, indicating a focus on scripting, data processing, and potentially simple GUI applications.

    C++: Several projects leverage C++, suggesting performance-critical components or more complex GUI implementations.

    Shell: Minor scripting components are also present in Shell.

Project Files and Their Potential Purpose

The repository contains the following key files, each likely representing a distinct application or module:

    camera_capture.py: A Python script likely designed for capturing images or video streams from a camera.

    filelogger.py: A Python utility for logging events, data, or application output to a file.

    gpio_toggle.cpp: A C++ program probably intended for controlling General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins, often used in embedded systems or hardware interaction.

    network_monitor.py: A Python script focused on monitoring network activity, such as bandwidth usage, connected devices, or network status.

    sensor_monitor.py: A Python application for reading and monitoring data from various sensors.

    temp_dashboard.cpp: A C++ application that could be a dashboard displaying temperature-related information, possibly from sensors or a system.

    video_player.cpp: A C++ application for playing video files.
